# Module 1- Key points

This first module introduces the basic risk and performance measures that are key to portfolio analysis and management. 

After introducing volatility as the standard risk measure, we also provide a discussion of the statistical significance and persistence of non-normality risks, emphasizing an understanding of higher-order moments and how to use them for allocating to assets with non-normal returns.

We also introduce downside risk measures such as Value-at-Risk and Conditional-Value-at-Risk measures, which are more relevant risk measures in the presence of non-normally distributed asset returns.
